# Energy Consumption in Industrial Buildings : Data Analysis and Generation

## Introduction

## The Notebooks

### Data Preprocessing : Creation of the Daily and the Hourly Datasets : 

### data_preprocessing.ipynb
* ### Creation of the Daily Dataset
* ### Creation of the Hourly Dataset

In this Jupyter Notebook, you will find all the steps we did to obtain the two datasets. Indeed, since we had at the beginning a dataset of the CO2 consumption produced per minutes in different sections of the buildings, we also wanted to have the consumption per hour and per day.
