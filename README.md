# Energy Consumption in Industrial Buildings : Data Analysis and Generation

## Introduction

## The Notebooks

### Data Preprocessing : Creation of the Daily and the Hourly Datasets : 

### data_preprocessing.ipynb
* ### Creation of the Daily Dataset
* ### Creation of the Hourly Dataset

In this Jupyter Notebook, you will find all the steps we did to obtain the two datasets. Indeed, since we had at the beginning a dataset of the CO2 consumption produced per minutes in different sections of the buildings, we also wanted to have the consumption per hour and per day. The idea behind is to highlight some particluar patterns within the data, for instance cycles. Cyclical phenonomena can appear on the scale of days and/or hours. This will be our focus in the next Jupyter Notebook.
